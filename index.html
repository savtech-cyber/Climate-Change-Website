      <h1>Climate Change And Initiatives</h1>
      <p>
        As climate change is taking a big toll on our planet we as a people have
        to realize and spread awareness throughout the world so as to help put
        an end to climate change and ensure a green pastured and well weathered
        world for future generations.So to do this we are spreading awareness on
        climate and how as a people we can follow the initiatives that have been
        put into place to have a better planet.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Climate Change?</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change is a long-term shift in global or regional climate
        patterns. Often climate change refers specifically to the rise in global
        temperatures from the mid-20th century to present that is climate
        change!!!

        The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of
        it is extremely likely (greater than 95% probability) to be the result
        of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate
        that is unprecedented over decades to millennia. Earth-orbiting
        satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientist to
        see the big picture, collecting many different types of information
        about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data,
        collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.The
        heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated
        in the mid-19th century. Their ability to affect the transfer of
        infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many
        instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of
        greenhouse gases must cause Earth to warm in response.Ice cores drawn
        from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that
        Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient
        evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs,
        and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence
        reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than
        the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming. Carbon dioxide from human
        activity is increasing more than 250 times faster than it did from
        natural sources after the last Ice Age.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have found out that climate change is taking place and throughout
        these past 10 years their is a 10 times rapid increase in climate change
        and if we do not act they will be rapid decline of our plant

        Why Its Important To Act On The Issue Of Climate change As A People
      </h1>
      <h2>The Temperature Or Global warming increase due To Climate Change</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past three years, climate scientists have shifted the
        definition of what they believe is the "safe" limit of climate change.
        For decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept
        below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts. But
        scientists now argue that keeping below 1.5C is a far safer limit for
        the world. Everyone agrees that remaining below that target will not be
        easy. This week in South Korea, researchers will report on the
        feasibility and costs of achieving this lower limit. The scientists of
        the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are gathering in
        the city of Incheon to hammer out a plan in cooperation with government
        delegates, on the actions that would need to be taken to meet this new
        goal.
      </p>
      <h2>The 1.5C Goal That Should Be Of Aim By 2100</h2>
      <p>
        As climate change organizations have set a goal for the world as whole
        that will help us reduce climate change and its impacts as the world is
        developing. This is a hard goal but not impossible for if we follow the
        mitigation and initiatives that have been provided and spread awareness
        we can achieve this goal or face the hash impacts and some we already
        experiencing

      <h1>What Causes Climate change?</h1>
      <p>
        The cause of current climate change is largely human activity, like
        burning fossil fuels, like natural gas, oil, and coal. The human
        influenced climate change that is happening now is occuring at a much
        faster rate. Burning these materials releases what are called greenhouse
        gases into Earth’s atmosphere. There, these gases trap heat from the
        sun’s rays inside the atmosphere causing Earth’s average temperature to
        rise. This rise in the planet's temperature is called global warming.
        The warming of the planet impacts local and regional climates.
        Throughout Earth's history, climate has continually changed. When
        occuring naturally, this is a slow process that has taken place over
        hundreds and thousands of years.

          Floods are considered second only to wildfires as the most common
          natural disaster on Earth. Flooding may occur as an overflow of water
          from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water
          overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping
          its usual boundaries,[2] or it may occur due to an accumulation of
          rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. While the size of a
          lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in
          precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be
          considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic
          animals.

          increasing due to human activities.

          largest increases occurring in the western United States, affecting

          2100. This is the result of added water from melting land ice and the
          expansion of seawater as it warms. In the next several decades, storm
          surges and high tides could combine with sea level rise and land
          subsidence to further increase flooding in many regions. Sea level
          rise will continue past 2100 because the oceans take a very long time

        The Paris Agreement For Climate Change Amongst Countries to Take Action

      <p>
        The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate
        change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December
        2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit
        global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius,
        compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this long-term temperature
        goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions
        as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century.
        The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change
        process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all
        nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat
        climate change and adapt to its effects.
      </p>
      <h2>How does the Paris Agreement work?</h2>
      <p>
        NDC explainer Implementation of the Paris Agreement requires economic
        and social transformation, based on the best available science. The
        Paris Agreement works on a 5- year cycle of increasingly ambitious
        climate action carried out by countries. By 2020, countries submit their
        plans for climate action known as nationally determined contributions
        (NDCs).
      </p>
      <h2>NDCs</h2>
      <p>
        In their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce
        their Greenhouse Gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris
        Agreement. Countries also communicate in the NDCs actions they will take
        to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures.
      </p>
      <h2>Long-Term Strategies</h2>
      <p>
        To better frame the efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris
        Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit by 2020 long-term
        low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS). LT-LEDS
        provide the long-term horizon to the NDCs. Unlike NDCs, they are not
        mandatory. Nevertheless, they place the NDCs into the context of
        countries’ long-term planning and development priorities, providing a
        vision and direction for future development.
      </p>
      <h2>How are countries supporting one another?</h2>
      <p>
        Paris Agreement support The Paris Agreement provides a framework for
        financial, technical and capacity building support to those countries
        who need it.
      </p>
      <h2>Finance</h2>
      <p>
        The Paris Agreement reaffirms that developed countries should take the
        lead in providing financial assistance to countries that are less
        endowed and more vulnerable, while for the first time also encouraging
        voluntary contributions by other Parties. Climate finance is needed for
        mitigation, because large-scale investments are required to
        significantly reduce emissions. Climate finance is equally important for
        adaptation, as significant financial resources are needed to adapt to
        the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of a changing climate.
      </p>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        The Paris Agreement speaks of the vision of fully realizing technology
        development and transfer for both improving resilience to climate change
        and reducing GHG emissions. It establishes a technology framework to
        provide overarching guidance to the well-functioning Technology
        Mechanism. The mechanism is accelerating technology development and
        transfer through it’s policy and implementation arms.
      </p>
      <h2>Capacity-Building</h2>
      <p>
        Not all developing countries have sufficient capacities to deal with
        many of the challenges brought by climate change. As a result, the Paris
        Agreement places great emphasis on climate-related capacity-building for
        developing countries and requests all developed countries to enhance
        support for capacity-building actions in developing countries.

        Global Stocktake explainer With the Paris Agreement, countries
        established an enhanced transparency framework (ETF). Under ETF,
        starting in 2024, countries will report transparently on actions taken
        and progress in climate change mitigation, adaptation measures and
        support provided or received. It also provides for international
        procedures for the review of the submitted reports. The information
        gathered through the ETF will feed into the Global stocktake which will
        assess the collective progress towards the long-term climate goals. This
        will lead to recommendations for countries to set more ambitious plans
        in the next round.

      <h2>What have we achieved so far?</h2>
      <p>
        Although climate change action needs to be massively increased to
        achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the years since its entry into
        force have already sparked low-carbon solutions and new markets. More
        and more countries, regions, cities and companies are establishing
        carbon neutrality targets. Zero-carbon solutions are becoming
        competitive across economic sectors representing 25% of emissions. This
        trend is most noticeable in the power and transport sectors and has
        created many new business opportunities for early movers. By 2030,
        zero-carbon solutions could be competitive in sectors representing over
        70% of global emissions.

        How We Can Spread Awareness And Examples Of People Spreading Awareness

            When it comes to spreading awareness, social media is one of the
            best tools at our disposal. You can reach millions of people all
            across the world with a single post. Make sure you maximize the
            potential of social media. Try to reach people outside of your
            social group. Use popular hashtags, and work to gain new followers.
            If you put in a little bit of extra effort, you should be able to
            get some big results.

            For a lot of people, climate change is something that is difficult
            to comprehend. After all, there are a lot of people out there
            dealing with horrible winter storms. These people may not feel like
            the planet is changing at all. You can reach these people by sharing
            stories that will tug at their heart strings. You might want to
            spread stories about the difficulties that polar bears are facing.
            Polar bears are a popular animal, and people will want to help them
            in any way they can.
          </td>
          <td>
            One of the easiest ways to turn people off is by using buzzwords.
            There are companies that have a vested interest in preventing
            changes to environmental legislation. These people have done their
            best to turn popular terms into dirty words. If you want to reach
            someone who doesn’t believe in global warming, avoid using any kinds
            of buzzwords. Instead, list specific problems and describe what they
            can do to help. These people will be a lot more responsive when
            buzzwords are removed from the conversation.
          </td>
          <td>
            One of the best ways to start spreading awareness is in your own
            community. Volunteer whenever you can, and get involved in local
            activities. Do what you can in the place that you live. Spreading
            global warming awareness isn’t always easy, but that doesn’t mean
            that it isn’t important. Do what you can to preserve this planet and
            keep it in the best shape that you can. If people are aware of the
            problems that we’re facing, they can start working to fix them. If
            more people take action, we might be able to change this planet’s
            future. If you don’t act, our planet could be facing extinction.
            Make sure you spread awareness and help to protect the many species
            that call the earth their home.In order to combat global warming,
            there are everyday tasks we as students can take in order to
            minimize its effects. Making conscious decisions to save energy such
            as turning off the lights, taking shorter showers, walking or
            biking, and closing doors immediately so heat does not escape are
            all simple choices that can help avoid serious consequences. While
            policy inatives across the world are necesary in order to enact
            lasting change, small communities making efforts to reduce their
            carbon footprint, utlizing reusable grocery bags, recycling, and
            aiming to save water all contribute to a greener tomorrow. By
            pushing these small initiatives forward, it sends a message to
            others that it is imperative to take care of the environment, or
            else society risks the threat of irresiveble effects. These effects
            include but are not limited to: more frequent wildfires, longer
            periods of droughts, and an increase in the number and duration of
            tropical storms. The United States is already witnessing these
            extreme weather phenomena as demonstrated by the devastating snow
            storm in Texas.
